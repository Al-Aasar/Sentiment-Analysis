# 💬 Sentiment Analysis App

A simple **Sentiment Analysis Web App** built with **Streamlit** and a pre-trained **LSTM model**.  
The app takes a text input and predicts whether the sentiment is **Positive**, **Negative**, or **Neutral**.

## 🧠 Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to deploy a deep learning model for **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** tasks using Streamlit.  
The LSTM model was trained on text data to classify sentiment and deployed through this interactive web interface.

### 🔹 Features:
- Clean and minimal user interface  
- Real-time sentiment prediction  
- Text preprocessing (URL, mentions, punctuation removal)  
- Uses Keras LSTM model with Tokenizer and LabelEncoder
